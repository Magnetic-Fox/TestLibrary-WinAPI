# Test Library (16-bit)

This repository contains very simple dynamic linked library code written to compile for 16-bit Windows using Open Watcom compiler. Just for test purposes (and discovering how to write code compatible with old Watcom compiler, which is not obvious).
The code contains one very simple function, LibMain (known as DllMain) and some resources.

## What to use to compile this code?

The code provided here was made to compile using Open Watcom IDE, which is quite good for modern MS-DOS/WfW3.11 development.
It's possible that it would compile using old Microsoft compilers, but I haven't tested it. It's best to use Watcom for it.
In fact, this project is heavily tied to Watcom coding style, so I think there might be serious problems with compiling it outside such environment.
